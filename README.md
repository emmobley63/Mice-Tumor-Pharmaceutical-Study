For this analysis we looked at the results from a study done on the effects of different drug regimens and their effects on tumorvolume.

We were given two data sets, one of the mouse metadata and the other of the test results. These two were combined to give us our base dataframe. From which we analyzed the effects on 248 different mice.

From our initial summary statistics on the mean and median tumor volume, the two with the smallest mean volume were Capomulin (40.68) and Ramicane (40.22). Indicating they may be the most effective at reducitng the size of the tumor. It is to be noted that these two drug regimens also had the largest number of mice tested.
There were slighlty more males (51%) to female (49%) mice in the study.

We then decided to investigate four of the drug regimens for outliers- Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Mouse c326 was the only outlier and she was treated with Infubinol. We can see her marked in the box and whisker plot in red.
